# Purpose
The purpose of this project will be to try and establish a flow for indie game dev.

I want to try the following:
1. Document all of the following 
1. Create a game story using some online tool
1. Create art assets inspired by the story
    - inspiration artwork
    - music
1. Create a game from the story
1. Create a dev log after the game is finished and set the release schedule to be once a week
1. Flesh out the story, try writing a short story

# Research
I had to learn some things to make this project
## Game story writing software
I used [Twine](https://twinery.org/cookbook/index.html) for the game story writing, as I needed a free, easy-to-use tool that would allow me to write divergent story paths. Games which have resonated strongly with me recently are more games from the 2000s and 2010s, where player choice had a significant impact on the story, so a tool that allows for different story paths was important to me.
## Music software
Garage band
    - Hard to find piano 03 loop?
## Video editing software
